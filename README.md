# Circle Dodge

## 🌀 Overview

Circle Dodge is a fast-paced, reflex-based game where your goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging incoming enemy circles. Simple in design but challenging in execution, the game tests your reaction time and strategic movement.

This project was inspired by an academic exercise and re-imagined as a fun, lightweight game built using Processing.

## 🕹️ How to Play

    Move your player circle using the arrow keys:

        ← → to move left and right

        ↑ ↓ to move up and down

    Avoid the red enemy circles—colliding with one ends the game.

    Survive as long as you can. The longer you last, the faster the enemies get, the more they grow in numbers. -
